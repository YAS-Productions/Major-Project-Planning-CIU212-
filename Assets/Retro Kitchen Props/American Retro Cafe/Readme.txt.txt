Thank you for your purchase!

To achieve the same graphics as you can see on screenshots and video you have to do next steps:

1. Switch the Color Space of the project to Linear in Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings;

2. Use Deferred rendering path. You can chose it in Edit > Project Settings > Graphics;

3. Use free Unity asset "Post Processing Stack v2" and the profile for it, which you can find in the Eirene/American Retro Cafe/Demo Scene folder.


To use Substance files in Unity 2017, simply unzip the Substance.zip archive that is placed in the Eirene/American Retro Cafe/ folder. If you use Unity 2018+, you have to download and import a free asset called "Substance in Unity" before unzipping the archive to avoide errors.

Thanks!
